2. Use the `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move the squares in the desired direction.
3. Squares with the same number will merge when they collide, doubling their value.
4. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
5. Continue playing and try to achieve the highest score possible.

## üéÆ Controls

-   `j` - move the squares down
-   `k` - move the squares up
-   `l` - move the squares to the right
-   `u` - undo the last move
-   `r` - restart (new game)
